          Web development has the perfect mix of fostering my creativity and critical thinking and it's fair to say I am more than hooked - I'm constantly thinking and learning about all things related to web development. With my background in digital marketing and graphic design, I bring skills and experience in other areas that may be of an asset to the team and the organization.

          Nature, exercising, animals and art are some of the other passions that I have. I like to go on hikes to enjoy the nature and push my physical self, I volunteer at an animal sanctuary to help and be with animals. I enjoy art with a needle in my hand (not the bad kind, this isn't about to get dark) - I'm a hobbyist tattoo artist and so far I've tattooed myself bunch of times, and two others!
